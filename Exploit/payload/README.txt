#How to compile the payload
Because we were testing a lot of things, we divided the compilation task in two;
the c_to_asm stage and the asm_to_bin stage. Names are descriptive.

#Requeriments
DevKitPro ARM

#Technical details
Copy payload.c to the "c_to_asm" folder, rename it to "main.c" and run make. You'll obtain main.s (assembly code)
Copy main.s to the "asm_to_bin" folder renamed to payload.s and run make. You'll obtain a .bin file (tha compiled payload)

#Final Steps
Inject manually the payload into the savegame, patch it with the CRCFix and enjoy!

#Important Note
In the assembly to binary compilation, the -Ttext=0x00000000 argument is important.
In ARM, branches (jumps) are relative so for the payload to access memory relative to it you
must set this value to where your payload will start in memory.
